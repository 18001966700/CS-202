      The only way to escape the room, other than the door, is to launch yourself out the window. You 
      contemplate your choices as you hear the knocks getting more and more aggressive and you begin 
      to panic. You decide you have no time, and launch yourself out of the window just as a man breaks 
      your door down.  
      "No!" you cry, as you have just fallen. The man rushes to the window and you recognize him as one 
      of your best friend colleagues from the police station. He tries to call down to you, but it's too late. 
      You begin what seems like an eternity of your descent to hell and, slowly, you feel the life leave your 
      body. You die.

      You find a tall, handsome police officer standing at the door. You recognize him from your best 
      friend precinct. You remember his name to be Rico. He immediately sees the blood on your hands 
      and holds a gun at you. However, upon further examination, he recognizes you and retreats. He's 
      still holding his handgun, and you're not sure if you can trust Rico.

        one of the guards taking notice in you. Suddenly, you realize the guard is the same police officer that 
        initially arrested you! One day, he comes to you and introduces himself as Rico. He says he has a

          too late, and by the time you try and explain yourself, you're handcuffed by Rico, who has tears in his eyes. 
          "Rico-" you start. But he cuts you off and reads you your rights. You can feel his hatred for you and 
          you're silent from then on. You go to prison and serve a life sentence. There, you die of old age many years later.

          murdered. You remember you and him fighting. You remember grabbing the knife you kept hidden in 
          the kitchen. He wanted to make up, and you didn't. He hugged you and impaled himself on the knife 
          in your hands. "No!" you scream, but it's too late. The dream was so vivid it couldn't possibly be fake! you accept 
          the fact that you did it and confess due to the newly surfaced grief you feel for your late Best friend.
